        The 1987 FA Cup Final was an association football match between Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur on 16 May
        1987 at Wembley Stadium in London to determine the winner of the 1986–87 FA Cup. It was the third final for
        Tottenham Hotspur in seven years and Coventry's first domestic cup final. Both clubs recorded songs to
        commemorate reaching the final. With the game tied 2–2 at full time, the match went into extra time. The only
        goal of extra time was scored in its first period when a cross from Lloyd McGrath looped off Gary Mabbutt's left
        knee for an own goal, making the final score 3–2 to Coventry. The match is regarded by many as one of the
        greatest finals in the history of the competition, with BBC TV commentator John Motson calling it "the finest
        Cup Final I've had the pleasure of commentating on". The 1987 FA Cup remains Coventry's only major tournament
        victory.
